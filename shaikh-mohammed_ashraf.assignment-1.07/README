Assignment 1.07: Parsing Monster Definitions

I began using Dr. Jeremy's code. I tried to model my error handling and parsing display after asking him a lot of questions.
I implemented mondesc class in parsermon.h to store my parsed info. 
parsermon.cpp deals with function (int fileparser()) and methods (int parsemon()) to handle parsing.
int deschecker() deals with some error detection in parsing but most of it is done in parsemon().
I have some commented portions too which are like displaying different things or different implementations.
