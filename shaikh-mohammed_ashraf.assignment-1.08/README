Assignment 1.08: Loading Monsters and Objects

This assignment I am still uding Dr. Jeremy's solution drop. 
I implemented a new class called object_class that is used for 
storing instances of objects. I have it in a file called objectclass.cpp
I have implemented two methods that are responsible for
generation of objects and monsters from their description. 
One is gen_monster_desc(dungeon *d, int where_from) in npc.h and npc.cpp
This generates monsters, where from is for knowing whether you're generating 
for the first time i.e from main() or by taking a staircase.
This was important because of special case of generating unique monters.
The function obj_factory(dungeon *d, int where_from) is in 
objectclass.cpp and the header for it. It generates object along the same
lines for artifact objects. 
Changes were made in the io.cpp file for printing new map for objects
called object_map which is the latest member addition for dungeon class.
Changes were also made in move.cpp to know if the monster is dead
for unique monster.
