assignment 1.05: User Interface with ncurses

This assignment required us to control PC. 
I changed my game_print() function to print on ncurses screen. The ncurses environment is initialized in main though. 
The menu is actually another window created atop the dungeon screen. Its created  when user presses 'm'. Gets deleted upon 'esc'.
The menu displays 14 monsters (from those who're alive) at a time page by page. 
I don't scroll one monster at a time since it'll be tedious for long monster list.
Pressing '<'/'>' on appropriate Stairs call the new_dungeon() which creates a different and new dungeon and monsters.
Also, game is paused when menu is opened and invalid keys do nothing.
