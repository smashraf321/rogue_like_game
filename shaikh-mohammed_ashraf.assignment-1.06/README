assignment 1.06: "fog of war" and porting to C++

NOTE: I am using my own code which does not have an organizational structure like Dr. Jeremy's code.
      Hence I am using a class for my waiting list for next turn for movement.
      Its a queue where monsters and PC are stored while they wait for their turn to move.
      This approach (my game development logic) doesn't make use of inheritance or similar concepts. 
      Using inheritance would require major refactoring. 
      According to post on Piazza Dr. jeremy said its okay not to use inheritance if we using our own code.

In this assignment, I implement functions like foggy_terrain_updater() and print_for_teleportation().
I have a map called foggy_terrain[][] that keeps the remembered terrain. Its updated by foggy_terrain_updater()
Displaying star and map for teleporting is managed by print_for_teleportation().
invalid_user_input_teleportation manages moving of star and placing PC when teleporting.
